# Individual project

## **Travel TODO List**

### **1.Getting Started with the project**

**`1.1.Description`**

This is created for Travel purpose, base on Java programming language, which can be used for simple â€œTravel list" to organised things. In addition to tracking the status of tasks, ToDoList includes a powerful system for logging and updating the list easily on tasks.

**`1.2.Specification of the project`**

There's really very little I need to say here since every feature/function is explicitly visible in different classes:

- TODO list has created by using Gradle project and related build tools.
- Files are stored in Text file format with **.rtf** file extension.
- Used **SimpleDateFormat** to format the date which is entered by user.
- Used **Stream** interface to accessing the collection of tasks.
